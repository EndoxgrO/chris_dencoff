    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a man with flattened, swooshy hair.. that man drew Vegeta
      better than anyone had ever seen. Pencil on paper, paint on canvas, chalk on the ground.. It
      didn't matter. One day he took that 2D designwork and transformed it into a wearable artform. Many
      might have though that it would have been scaled to only fit himself. But no.. Men, women, children,
      and pugs alike have all been muses for inspiration.

    If you have not seen or been subjected to the 'Pug AT-AtT' then you have not lived. Limiting himself
    to no bounds he has worn many hats; cement mason, carpenter, door framer and a man unafraid of
    porch crawlers. This guy creates. For work or pleasure his foresight and creativity has shown to
    not only be lucritive but astounding.

    <h3>A Little Background</h3>
    <p>
     From Oregon to the desert and back again, Chris Dencoff graduated out of a high school in Scappoose.
     Noone knows why he attended school there (while living in St. Helens). He had previously excelled in bowling shirts and having two, very interchangeable, first names.
     After a stint in semi-profession Halo gaming he took an interest in running and hair straightening, soon
      after he was initiated into the 'Minor Inconvenience Gang' which ultimately led to a lenghthy prison sentence.
      There he honed his craft in drawing and sculpting and has been quoted saying "Creating is my focus now, while
      it is inarguable that Cuntalope is funny.. that is no longer is how I define my art."

  <h2>Favored Mediums</h2>
  <p>
  Christopher has been unlimited in his knack for creating something from nothing.
  While artists may appreciated his pencil shading, foam manipulation, metal/ woodworks
  and color contrasting, it would be reprehensible to exclude his fine work in:

          What was only a fun concept, blew up to an internet sensation.
          After taking the head off of an (prior to DNA evidcence being uncovered) innocent snowman.
          He was later able to film the grueling assault done to a, very poorly mustacioed, man by
          a close relative of the aforementioned snowman.
